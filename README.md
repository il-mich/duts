### Yeah
Basic repo created in the home directory, pretty barbaric, _I know_.

Zsh configuration is based off of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) with the [typewritten](https://github.com/reobin/typewritten) user theme.

Vim configuration uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage some plugins.

Thanks for coming to may Dot Talk.
